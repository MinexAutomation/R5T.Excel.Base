R5T.Excel.Base - A base library of Excel functionality.

This library contains Excel-related functionality that does NOT depend on Excel COM automation via primary interop assemblies (PIAs).

Understandably, this functionality is rather limited. However, functionality includes:

* Starting Excel with an Excel file path. This is useful for automatically opening the results of an analysis for user review.
